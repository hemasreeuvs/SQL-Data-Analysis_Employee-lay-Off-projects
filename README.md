# SQL-Data-Analysis_Employee-lay-Off-projects

**Summary of the Project**

This project focuses on data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis using SQL on a Layoffs Dataset sourced from Kaggle. The dataset contains records of company layoffs, including total laid-off employees, industry, country, funding, and more. The goal is to ensure data accuracy, remove inconsistencies, and derive meaningful insights.

**Key Steps in Data Cleaning**

>>  Data Collection & Cleaning – Imported raw data, structured it, and created a new table for cleaning.
 
>> Removing Duplicates – Identified and eliminated duplicate records to maintain data integrity.
 
>> Standardizing Data – Cleaned company names, industry labels, and country names for consistency.
 
>> Handling Null Values – Replaced missing values with appropriate defaults or inferred them based on related data.
 
>> Time Format Standardization – Converted date fields into proper date format for accurate time-based analysis.

 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

>> Total Layoffs Analysis – Identified companies and industries with the highest layoffs.

>> Industry-Wise Layoffs – Aggregated total layoffs per industry to understand sector-wise trends.
 
>> Country-Wise Layoffs – Analyzed layoffs by country to identify geographic trends.
 
>> Yearly Layoff Trends – Examined layoffs by year to observe economic impact over time.
 
>> Stage-Wise Layoffs – Determined which funding stage companies were in when layoffs occurred.
 
>> Rolling Total Layoffs – Computed cumulative layoffs over time for trend analysis.
 
>> Top Companies Affected – Ranked companies with the highest layoffs year-over-year.
